# acs_geodist

HST/ACS geometric distortion correction.

At the moment, the state of the code is as follows:
- It is a python port/reimplementation of Vera's FORTRAN code(s)
- It is very much still in alpha. It is unoptimized, not properly object-oriented, and probably buggy.
- That being said, it should work if all the inputs are as expected.

I plan to work on this more in the future.
But for now, the goal is just to have a working version for ACS.
